          <p class="milli">After I figured out the logo concept, I went and cleaned up the logo. I rounded the corners more and made the bottom of the tooth even. After that, I changed the colours because I wanted them to be brighter.</p>

        <p>This newly designed logo shows a simple approach to instill trust in the patient to keep them coming back. This design of showing multiple teeth and not just one tooth is to represent many of the dental services provided for every patient. With this design approach, they understand that this dentist has everything to have them and their families leave with a healthy smile.</p>

It also shows that it can be read far away on a storefront, which was my main goal. </p>

        <h3>The Accomplished Objectives</h3>
        <h4 class="push-0 mega">Logo</h4>
        <p>For it being a simplistic logo, it allows more of the expenses to be focused on branding. Allowing the costs to remain under for this small business. This logo design enforces trust and shows the many dental services that patients want in a dentist so they can keep coming back.</p>
        <h4 class="push-0 mega">Colours</h4>
        <p>These colours are both refreshing and relaxing to represent the overall experience of going to this dentist. With these shades of blue, it gives off the feeling of trust and tranquillity. It benefits the company by showing to patients first hand that they can be at ease when they go to book an appointment. This will get new patients coming through the door and that they will always be in great hands.</p>
