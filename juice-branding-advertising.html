        <p class="orange bold-weight push-0 mega">Brand</p>
        <p class="">This brand is a healthy juice company that wants to break down the barrier of seriousness. They want to promote the fact that 100% natural can be 100% fun too. I wanted this design to attract a more youthful and energetic crowd. With fresh illustrations and humourous flavours its something that stands out to the eye at first glance.</p>
        <p class="orange bold-weight push-0 mega">Juice Box</p>
        <p>To go even further with the concept I came up with the idea of having a subscription box called Juice Box. This gives young customers the option to have fresh juice delivered to their door which is popular in our society.</p>
        <p class="orange bold-weight push-0 mega">Motion Advertisement</p>
        <p>The advertisement I designed is to promote the Juice Box and to get people to order as soon as they see it. To get people’s attention quickly I added motion to the illustrations. Which is something that isn’t found a lot in illustrative designs. As soon as the advertisement catches the eye there is a big call to action button on the right which is the website link to order a box.</p>
