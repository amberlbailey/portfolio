          <p class="milli">For this group project, we had to think of a group of people that we would have easy access to complete a survey from us. Those people were retail workers to complete it to answer our research questions before even thinking about an app idea. First, we did a mind map of what came to mind when we thought of retail workers. Followed by the empathy map of our own experiences working retail, then the assumption chart of what we assume and what we want to learn. After we did these together, we did extensive background research and began thinking of our survey questions to help answer the unanswered questions.</p>

          <p class="milli">After prototyping, we went to test it and found some friction. The most significant friction we identified while testing our app was getting the users to figure out how to schedule employees for a shift. For the user to see the employee list to get Ben to work 5-10pm, they would have to select the hidden drawer above the tab bar with the employee list. Them not being able to see it caused friction for the users because they would try to click on the date on the manager's schedule screen to try to give the employee a shift.</p>

        <h3 class="push-0">Brand</h3>
        <p>inCheck's brand was to be as intuitive and straightforward as possible because it's an app for both employee and managers. Mostly grey and white but with pops of colour to lead the user and guide them through the app.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 xl-1 max-length gutter">
        <h3 class="push-0">Underlying Magic</h3>
        <p>Our users have to struggle to download multiple employee scheduling/chat apps because the apps are missing features that others have. This problem has led us to create inCheck so retail workers can stop struggling and have all the features they're looking for in one app. Instead of having retail workers download multiple apps to get a single function, we created inCheck that has them all.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 xl-1 max-length gutter">
        <h3 class="push-0">Value Proposition</h3>
        <p>This app benefits both employees and management. For management, it saves paper and the hassle of having to track people down. It also improves the time management to be able to keep track of their staff effectively. For employees, it makes booking time off more accessible because they can automatically send to management for approval. It also allows them to find a replacement in the case of an emergency.</p>
