          <p class="milli">Throughout this project, we worked on a team to make a small web app prototype. We struggled with figuring out an idea that was unique yet easy to be coded using HTML. Then we thought about college students and an app that they could use. Something that needs to be solved is college students and their cooking skills when it comes to dietary or financial restrictions. Having something that could help them cook with whatever is in the fridge but with a twist at poking fun at the user so they can learn to laugh at themselves to keep on trying.</p>

          <p class="milli">For the logo, I wanted it to be straight forward and clear so that this app will make the user eat in and not to eat out. When we came up with the idea, I had a clear vision of the logo concept, which rarely comes to me. So here is my process of creating the logo and also deciding that yellow wasn't the right colour and I changed to orange. As I felt orange was more suitable to use as it's more appetizing and it gives off a warm feeling, so first-hand users aren't intimidated.</p>

        <h3>The Accomplished Objectives</h3>
        <h4 class="push-0 mega">Making A Recipe App Unique</h4>
        <p>There are many cooking apps out there, but most of them don't have any personality for the user to connect with to make it easier. Something that makes them feel better by laughing at themselves, so they don't take their cooking skills too seriously. When something gets burnt, or it doesn't taste right, they will laugh at themselves then get back up and try it again. Hopefully not burning down the kitchen in the process.</p>
        <h4 class="push-0 mega">Coded Web App</h4>
        <p>When doing this design, I had to keep in mind the limitations that HTML has, especially with a time frame. It was difficult not to get lost in making a super intricate design as the end goal was to create a pattern library. The pattern library was coded by <span class=
        "orange-fade"> Raquel Alves </span> to be able to build the web app and it was a success.</p>
