When everyone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I had no idea until I went to New York City. It wasn't until I was staring at a billboard that I said to myself "I want to do this". Having this experience has inspired me to try anything new and to take on any challenge.

How is it still an inspiration to you.
What got me into design, passionate. What happened after. personal.
